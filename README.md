### Discovering devices
**IMPORTANT !**

In order to discover and control the xiaomi yeelight devices in the local network, you have to download and install yeelight app and enable the LAN control for each device.

Android Application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yeelight.cherry&hl=en
IOS Application: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yeelight/id977125608?mt=8

To get a list of devices, simply use the async function:

    List<Device> devices = await Yeelight.DiscoverDevices();
    OR 
    List<Device> devices = Yeelight.DiscoverDevices().Result; //for synchronous
You should also let firewall to allow request in the first run.

### Controlling

The API designed in a fluent fashion so you can chain methods to control devices with an organized code.
Ex: `devices[0].Toggle().SetBrightness(20).WaitCmd(2000).SetRgbColor(0,255,0).WaitCmd(5000).SetBrightness(5).SetColorTemperature(2000);`

These device functions are extension methods on device class in YeelightFunctions static class.

The **onPropertyChanged** event can be used to notify when a property changes through indexer of Device class.

### Reading values

 Read values through indexer of **Device** class. It takes **DeviceProperty** enum for parameter.
 Ex:

     mDevice[Yeelight.DeviceProperty.Brightness]
     mDevice[Yeelight.DeviceProperty.ColorTemperature]
     mDevice[Yeelight.DeviceProperty.Name]
